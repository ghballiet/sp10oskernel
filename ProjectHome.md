We will design and develop a complete Operating System Kernel for the ARM processor. The target platform is the TS-7200 embedded development board from Technologic Systems. For development, we will use Virtutech Simics. According to the academic license for Simics, any extensions to Simics that are developed will be made available at least to Virtutech (including device models developed).
