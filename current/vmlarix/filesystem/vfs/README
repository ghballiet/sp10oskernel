This directory contains the virtual filesystem layer.  The virtual
filesystem is responsible for mounting and unmounting the real
filesystems.  It maintains the list of mount points.

The vfs also handles requests to open and close files, and manages the
systemwide table of file descriptors.  For an open request, it finds
the mount point for the filesystem containing the requested file, and
passes the request on to the driver for that filesystem.

Read, write and other file requests cause the vfs to translate from
the process's file descriptor number to the systemwide file
descriptor, and pass the request on to the correct filesystem driver.

vfs.h contains the list of functions that vfs provides to the kernel.
